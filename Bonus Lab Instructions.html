    <h3>Two-dimensional arrays</h3>
    <p>
        In this lab, we will set up a chess board in a two dimensional array that stores our pieces. A two dimensional
        array is simply an array that stores more arrays. You can imagine a
        two dimensional array as a grid where you need to specify two indicies to access any specific part of that grid.
        For example, if I set up the following 2-D array:
        <p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">
            var grid = [
            <br>
            [0, 1, 2],<br>
            [3, 4, 5],<br>
            [6, 7, 8]<br>
            ];
        </p>
        I can get the value stored at the 1st row and 3rd column by writing:
        <p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">
            var value = grid[0][2];
        </p>
        Our variable, value, will store the number, 2. Notice, that the first refernce is always the row, and the second
        is the column.
    </p>
